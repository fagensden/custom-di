So, what is our project?

It is an enhancement of Crediar's sneek project. It has a number of new features:

  * It can launch backup games in wbfs format from a fat32 formatted drive.
  * It can use an emulated nand in a subfolder of the drive, and not only on the root of it.
  * It can switch from one emulated nand to another on the fly. So you can run a game in it's own region nand.
  * It has Uneek\_usb\_fs support. This means that homebrew can have usb access again with minor modifications, using the isfs filing system.
  * It can co√∂perate with bootmii. It doesn't launch automatically every time on a bootmii as boot2 wii.
  * It can run from ~~SD or~~ USB without a SD card inserted.
  * It's has DM/DML/Quadforce support.
  * It has 3TB and up HDD support.
